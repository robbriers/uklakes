The [UK CEH Lake Portal](https://uklakes.ceh.ac.uk/) is a GIS-based inventory 
of information about more than 40000 lakes across the UK. The information 
available for each lake varies, but includes basic physical description, 
typology and other information.

The `uklakes` package allows you to retrieve a summary of the lake information 
for a lake or series of lakes, based on the lake wbid (waterbody id) number. 
It does this by responsibly webscraping the information (using the [polite package](https://cran.r-project.org/package=polite)) from the webpage of each 
lake as the website does not provide an API or any easy way to extract the data
returned. You can also search for lake wbid values based on strings in the lake 
name to determine the wbids to search for.

Information on the general physical characteristics, typology, chemistry and 
connectivity metrics are retrieved. Biology, Land cover and water quality 
information are not. For details of the information available, see the 
[UK Lakes Portal Website](https://uklakes.ceh.ac.uk/), or the [output reference list](https://robbriers.github.io/uklakes/articles/uklakes_output_ref.html).
